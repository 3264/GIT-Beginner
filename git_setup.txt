>> To clone a repo use
	git clone repourl (get ssh url from repo settings)

>> to remove file use 
	git rm "filepath with name"

>> git commit -m "reason" will commit the changes

>> "gitk &" will shows commits in new window.

>> To push into remote repo use 
	git push origin master

>> To pull from remote repo use
	git pull origin master

>> gitk is a review tool. All details of commits are presented in this tool. We can review changes in gitk window. It will show all the commits, the commiter name, committed date, files present in a commit and the differences in each file.

>> A "git pull" will fail/abort when you have some local changes and some other committer also changed the same file. So always you have to stash your local changes and do a "git pull" and again apply the stashed changes.

>> "git stash" command is used to hide the changes.
>> "git stash pop" command is used to get back the hidden changes.

>> "merge conflict occurs" when some changes occurs in the same line by different collaborators.
